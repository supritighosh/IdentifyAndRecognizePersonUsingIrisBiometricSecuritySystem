# Identify and Recognize Person Using Iris Biometric Security System

I have used automated iris recognition for personal identification to verify both uniqueness of the human iris and also its performance as a biometric based system. The performance of research was measured for stored database which is scored 0% each for False Reject Rate (FRR) and False Accept Rate (FAR) and consequently, iris recognition is shown to be a precise and reliable biometric technology.
